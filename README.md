## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is another front-end challenge attempt.

Tried experimenting with clamp() to adjust various sizes, instead of using media queries.

### Continued development

Using clamp() was mostly trial and error. Would like to learn more about it, and how to use it more effectively.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)\
  Kevin is an amazing teacher, and I based my solution on his many excellent examples.
